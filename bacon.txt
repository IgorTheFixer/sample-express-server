The best method for cooking bacon is to start with a cold skillet or frying pan. 
Lay the bacon strips in a single layer, making sure they are not overlapping. 
Place the skillet on medium heat and allow the bacon to slowly heat up and render its fat. 
Flip the bacon occasionally to ensure even cooking. 
As the bacon begins to crisp up, monitor its progress and remove it from the pan when it reaches your desired level of crispness. 
Place the cooked bacon on a paper towel-lined plate to drain off any excess fat. 
This method allows the bacon to cook evenly and become crispy without burning, 
resulting in delicious and perfectly cooked bacon slices.
